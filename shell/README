Create an account, such as "cdba" and run ./setup.sh as this user.
Give the user a password, or setup authorized_keys

Then from the other machine: git clone cdba@host

Add a file "admins" listing the names of the admins, add your cdba config file
as "cdba" and create a directory "keydir" populated with id_rsa.pub files,
named <name>.pub - where <name> is referenced against the admins list.
